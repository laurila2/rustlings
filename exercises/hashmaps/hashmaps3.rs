// hashmaps3.rs

// A list of scores (one per line) of a soccer match is given. Each line
// is of the form :
// <team_1_name>,<team_2_name>,<team_1_goals>,<team_2_goals>
// Example: England,France,4,2 (England scored 4 goals, France 2).

// You have to build a scores table containing the name of the team, goals
// the team scored, and goals the team conceded. One approach to build
// the scores table is to use a Hashmap. The solution is partially
// written to use a Hashmap, complete it to pass the test.

// Make me pass the tests!

// Hint 1: Use the `entry()` and `or_insert()` methods of `HashMap` to insert entries corresponding to each team in the scores table.
// Learn more at https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch08-03-hash-maps.html#only-inserting-a-value-if-the-key-has-no-value
// Hint 2: If there is already an entry for a given key, the value returned by `entry()` can be updated based on the existing value.
